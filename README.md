# 🧠 Shouldify – AI-Powered “Should I?” Decision Helper

Shouldify is a basic static webpage where I revisited and practiced core web development concepts.  
The site acts as a smart assistant that helps users answer common **“Should I…”** questions using either **AI-based** or **rule-based** logic.

Whether you're debating taking a break, switching careers, or buying that new gadget — Shouldify gives you a reasoned suggestion in a lightweight and friendly interface.
